# Zo

This tool displays maps used in my worldbuilding projects. 

It supports displaying different levels of regional divisions. These divisions must be drawn in a specific format that [one of my other projects](https://github.com/JWeel/Mup) can help create.

It also has some support for creating areas dynamically, including labeling and coloring them.
