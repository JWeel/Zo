g# => g: geographical regions #: index

more societal organizations (institutions?) : feudal, theocratic, mercantile -> hierarchital (with T not C) 

show g# borders only for current selected fief

why have cell? what does it give over g0? only thing right now is neighbors

fiefs:
    contain regions (and cell?)
    require selection logic for fiefs -> may be able to mostly reuse same stuff because fief has region
    is a hierarchy of fiefs, so contains fief collection property
    region for root fief encompasses all regions of child fiefs + demesne (so demesne should be region also)
    fiefs should cover all g0/cells? uncontrolled g0/cells could be controlled by placeholder fief?
    new scenario class should contain fiefs in a prearranged manner, possibly taken from external data file (csv?)

maybe region should be collection of cells but have its own texture for performance

load regions async

deselect should be regardless of maptype

if fief is disconnected, have multiple regions?

gameplay could be
    every g0 should contain a character. each character has liege.
    independent fief ruler controls direct vassals (and to a lesser extent indirect vassals)
    there is a fixed number of moments per year (for these notes will be called ticks)
    during each tick (for now 12 ticks per year) each character can take a certain amount of actions
    number of actions depends on factors (realm size, advisors, skill, peace/war, popular support, etc)
    each character commands a certain number of men-at-arms and can call up a militia
    lieges can demand levies from vassals (% men-at-arms)
    end of each year every ruler will level up and gain or lose skill points
    characters gain a lot of skill points while young and less while old
    actions can be stuff like moving around armies, sending letters, assigning vassals to do stuff
    goal is up to player, but can expand realm through war, inheritance, and scheming
